# Simple timetracker to avoid manual excel entry
Notes:

To use:
- seed & change csv name/save location as desired
- create username (doesn't really matter what it is yet)
- start server

* you have to hit "Break" for an activity to "end"; otherwise it'll continue indefinitely

would be cool to do but probably wont:
- host online
- omniauth + gh integration for meaningful account usage
- limit file generation to the 5 weekdays of week prior, as opposed to all 7 days
- smarter/more efficient report generation
- aesthetics
- analytics
